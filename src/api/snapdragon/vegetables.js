        "<i>Cucumis sativus</i>, the garden cucumber, is a widely cultivated plant in the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae), which includes squash, and in the same genus as the muskmelon and cantaloupe. The cucumber likely originated in India, where it appears to have been cultivated for more than 3,000 years, then spread to China. The Romans likely introduced it throughout Europe. Hundred of cultivars of varying size and color are now grown in warm areas worldwide, commercially and in home gardens. \r\n\r\nCucumber is a frost-sensitive annual—its heat requirement is greater than that for most common vegetables, and in northern climates, it is often grown in greenhouses or hoop houses. It has a hairy climbing, trailing, or creeping stem, and is often grown on frames or trellises. Leaves are hairy and have 3–5 lobes; branched tendrils at leaf axes support climbing. Plants are usually monoecious (male and female flowers on separate plants), but varieties show a range of sexual systems. Female flowers are yellow with 5 petals, and develop into a cylindrical fruit, which may be as large as 60 centimeters (24 in) long and 10 centimeters (3.9 in) in diameter. The color ranges from green to yellow to whitish; in many varieties, fruits are bicolored with longitudinal stripes from stem to apex. \r\n\r\nSome varieties produce seedless fruit without pollination, but others are most productive with pollination by various bee species. Hives of honeybees, <i>Apis mellifera</i> are often transported to cucumber fields just before flowering time, but bumblebees (<i>Bombus</i> spp.) and other bee species can also serve as pollinators.\r\n\r\nThe numerous varieties of cucumbers have been categorized in diverse ways. One general classification is to group them as “slicing,” which are large and smooth- but somewhat tough-skinned and generally eaten when green to avoid a bitter flavor; “pickling,” which are usually smaller, with prickly skins; and \"burpless,” which include seedless varieties as well as long, narrow, Asian types.\r\n\r\nWhen mature, the cucumber fruit is 90% water, and is not particularly high in nutrients, but its flavor and texture have made it popular for use as a fresh addition to salads, as well as pickled and prepared in relishes. In Africa, cucumber seeds are used to make an oil for use in salads and cooking. Cucumbers are also used in skin tonics and other beauty aids.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, total production of cucumbers and gherkins (which can refer to a cucumber variety but also to fruit of the related <i>Cucumis anguria</i>) was 60.6 million tons, harvested from 2 million hectares. China was by far the largest producer, with a harvest of 44.3 million tons; Turkey, Iran, and the Russian Federation followed, producing 1–2 millon tons, and the U.S. ranked 5th, with 888 thousand tons. Within the U.S., Florida, California, Georgia, and Michigan are generally leading producers.\r\n\r\n(Encyclopedia Britannica 1993, FAOSTAT 2011, Hedrick 1919, Kirkbride 1993, Whittaker and Davis 1962, Wikipedia 2011)\r\n"

        "<i>Beta vulgaris</i>, the beet or beetroot, is an annual or biennial herbaceous plant in the Amaranthaceae, the amaranth family (formerly placed in Chenopodiaceae, the goosefoot or spinach family), which originated in southern Europe and western Asia, and has been developed into three distinct varieties specialized for different edible parts of the plant: Swiss chard (var. <i>cicla</i>), which has large leaves and prominent fleshy stems is used as a leafy vegetable; sugar beet (var. <i>vulgaris</i>), which has a very large, irregularly shaped fleshy root (up to 0.35 m, or 1 ft, long and weighing 1.5 to 2.5 kg, or 3 to 5 pounds) that lacks the red color typically associated with beets, and is used as a source of sugar (the sugar refined from it is sucrose, the same as that from sugar cane, <i>Saccharum</i> species) and as animal fodder; and beet or beetroot (previously classified var. <i>esculenta</i>, although now usually placed in the same group with var. <i>vulgaris</i>), which has a red to purple fleshy spherical or elongated root and is used as a root vegetable. All three varieties were derived from the wild sea-beet (often classified as <i>B. vulgaris</i> var. <i>maritima</i>).\r\n\r\nBeets of all varieties typically grow in a basal rosette, then with alternate leaves on flowering stems, which can grow to 1.25 m (4 ft) in the biennial sugarbeet varieties, but are typically 0.5 to 0.75 m (1.5 to 2.5 ft) in Swiss chard and beetroot. The flowers are typically small, greenish to yellow, growing in small clusters on slender spikes, with a 5-parted calyx that lacks petals. The fruit often develops from aggregates of two or more flowers joined at their bases, and forms a small, spiny or hard, irregularly shaped “seed” with a woody calyx.\r\n\r\nThe leaf, leaf stalks, and roots of beet plants are edible. The leaves are high in vitamin A and minerals including calcium, iron, potassium, and magnesium. Beetroots are high in magnesium and manganese, with some vitamin C. The leaves of Swiss chard and beetroot plants can be used in salads but are more often prepared as a cooked green, or in soups or tarts; the stems of Swiss chard are sometimes prepared similarly to asparagus (<i>Asparagus officinale</i>). Beetroots are often cooked as a vegetable, and are very typical in Flemish and Slavic (northern European) cuisines, including the popular Russian and Polish beet soup (borscht or barszcz). They are also frequently pickled and served as a salad or condiment, or are occasionally grated and used fresh in salads. Sugar beets account for roughly 1/5 of the world’s total production of sucrose (refined sugar), and are a key source of sugar in north temperate climates (sugar maple, <i>Acer saccharum</i>, is another leading northern source). The molasses produced as a by-product of refining sugar from sugar beets is used to make vinegar and yeast, as well as antibiotics.\r\n\r\n (Bailey et al. 1976, van Wyk 2005, Wikipedia 2012.)"

        "<p><em>Cucurbita pepo</em> is a species of squash (family Cucurbitaceae, the gourd or cucumber family) endemic to the New World that includes many common kitchen squash varieties including acorn squash, pumpkin, zucchini, and pattypans (see types listed below).&nbsp; Archeological evidence shows it to be one of the world&rsquo;s earliest domesticated species, first cultivated between 8000-10,000 years ago in Mesoamerica, probably southern Mexico (Smith 1997; Decker 1988). &nbsp;Many molecular studies have investigated the controversial origin of C. pepo and relationship to its two closest relatives, <em>C. fraternal </em>and <em>C. texana</em> (Sanjur et al. 2002; Decker-Walters et al. 2003).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in\">A broad diversity of inter-fertile<em> C. pepo </em>varieties and subspecies resulted from this 10,000 year cultivation period, producing fruits with such a vast array of different forms, colors and textures that the types are often misidentified as distinct species.&nbsp; These fruits include summer squashes (e.g. zucchini and pattypan), which are eaten as immature fruits with tender skin and soft seeds and winter squashes (e.g.pumpkins and acorn squash) harvested in the fall as mature fruits with tough skin and hardened seeds which are usually removed prior to eating the fruit&rsquo;s flesh. &nbsp;There are also several varieties of inedible gourds exhibiting terrific range in shape, colors, texture and size.&nbsp; Based primarily on fruit shape, Paris (1986) proposed a list of eight basic edible groups and one group of inedible gourds, into which almost all varieties of<em> C. pepo </em>can be classified (listed below; Wikipedia 2013).</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in\"><em>Cucurbita pepo</em> grows as a large annual vine, historically in areas from sea level up to 2000 m. (6500 ft.) in altitude.&nbsp; It has large, showy, yellow-orange, insect-pollinated flowers and round, lobed leaves, often with fine hairy prickles.&nbsp; Like all species in the family, it is frost-sensitive.&nbsp; Various parts of<em> C. pepo</em> plants are edible including the fruit, flowers, young leaves and seeds, and it is an agricultural species of great importance, cultivated around the world.&nbsp; Seeds, leaves, sap and pulp have long been used for medicinal purposes including treatment of intestinal worms, urinary issues, and poultices for burns.&nbsp; The vines and fruit are used as fodder for livestock, and gourds used for a vast array of ornamental, traditional and functional purposes&nbsp;(Kew 2013; Saade and Montes Hernandez 1994; Wikipedia 2013).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Summer squash </strong><em><strong>Cucurbita pepo</strong></em><strong> cultivars include:</strong><br />\r\n&bull;crookneck (var. <em>torticollia</em>),<br />\r\n&bull;straightneck (var. <em>recticollis</em>),<br />\r\n&bull;scallop (var. <em>clypeata</em>),<br />\r\n&bull;zucchini (var. <em>cylindrica</em>),<br />\r\n&bull;cocozzelle (var. <em>longa</em>),<br />\r\n&bull;vegetable marrow (var. <em>fastigata</em>; some forms of this variety, such as spaghetti squash, are winter squashes)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Winter squash </strong><em><strong>Cucurbita pepo</strong></em><strong> cultivars include: </strong><br />\r\n&bull;pumpkin (var. <em>pepo</em>),<br />\r\n&bull;acorn squash (var. <em>turbinata</em>)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Inedible gourds:</strong><br />\r\n<em>C. pepo</em> var. <em>ovifera</em> (egg-shaped, pear-shaped),<br />\r\n<em>C. pepo</em> var. <em>aurantia</em> (orange color),<br />\r\n<em>C. pepo</em> var. <em>verrucosa</em> (round warty gourds),<br />\r\n<em>C. pepo</em> var. <em>texana</em> ornamental gourds found in Texas (sometimes considered a distinct species, <em>C. texana</em>, this form is possibly the ancestor of <em>C. pepo</em>, although the genetics are complicated and debated)<em>,</em><br />\r\n<em><em>C. pepo</em></em> var. <em>ozarkana</em> ornamental gourds found outside of Texas (Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana)</p>\r\n"

        "<i>Brassica rapa</i>, field mustard, is an herbaceous annual or biennial species in the Brassicaceae (the cabbage or mustard family) from which various interrelated vegetable varieties have been developed, including turnips, bok choi, pak choi, tat soi (which are sometimes referred to as Chinese cabbages, or Chinese white- or Chinese flat cabbages, or celery mustard), pak choi sum (Chinese flowering cabbage), and napa cabbage (also called celery cabbage or pe tsai), among others. The species is thought to have originated in Europe, with many varieties developed in Asia, but its numerous varieties are now widely cultivated commercially and in home gardens in temperate and north temperate regions throughout the world. Some varieties have become naturalized and are considered weeds in regions of China and North America.\r\n\r\n<i>B. rapa</i>, formerly known as <i>B. campestris</i>, shows considerable variation in growth form and characteristics across the many cultivars, this species has, in general, a flat or globose root (in the case of turnips) without an elongated crown (as found in the rutabagas and kohlrabi, which are derived from B. <i>olearacea</i>), with stems that grow typically grow 30 to 120 cm (11.75 to 47.25 in), although in some cultivars up to 190 cm (75 in) tall. The leaves are large, soft, smooth or soft-hairy leaves, up to 50 cm (20 in) long, pinnatifid (deeply lobed) or lyrate (deeply lobed, but with an enlarged terminal lobe and smaller lateral lobes), which clasp the stem and may form a more or less dense head. The yellow, four-parted and cross-shaped flowers are small, usually less than 2 cm (0.75 in) long, and produce siliques—capsular fruit that dehisces (splits open) when mature—that may be up to 6 cm (2.5 in) long.\r\n\r\nWith a long history of cultivation and diversification into many varieties with numerous and overlapping common names, it can be difficult to ascertain and classify the relationships among species and varieties (or subspecies). Varieties of <i>B. rapa</i> are generally placed into 4 major categories:\r\n\r\n1)\tvar. <i>chinensis</i>, which includes pak choi, bok choi, and tat soi, cultivars that originated in southeast Asia and have long been cultivated in China and Japan, where they are also widely naturalized. These form compact clusters of stems that are not as densely packed as in cabbage heads. The whole young plants are used for their leafy greens and fleshy green or white stems, either salted and fermented into a pickle known as pak choi can, or cooked in soups, stir-fries, and noodle dishes.\r\n\r\n2)\tvar. <i>parachinensis</i>, Chinese flowering cabbage (sometimes called Chinese broccoli, although that name generally refers to the related <i>B. olearacea</i> var. <i>alboglabra</i>), which has elongated fleshy stems and flowering shoots that do not form into tight clusters or heads. The flowering stems, along with their leaves and buds, are pickled or prepared as a cooked vegetable in numerous Asian dishes.\r\n\r\n3)\tvar. <i>pekinensis</i>, napa or celery cabbage (sometimes known as Peking cabbage or pe tsai), which may either have a dense head of flat-stemmed leaves, or may form simply a loose cluster of fleshy stemmed leaves. These varieties have a long history of cultivation in China, Japan, and Korea, where they are used in salads, soups, and as a cooked vegetable. This variety is commonly used to make the traditional Korean fermented cabbage dish, <i>kimchee</i>.  \r\n\r\n4)\tvar. <i>rapa</i>, turnips, which have a fleshy, globe-shaped root. Described in Roman accounts dating to 400 B.C., they are one of the oldest cultivated root crops, and are still widely used in Europe, prepared raw or cooked in soups, stews, and sautés. The young leaves are also used as cooked greens.\r\n\r\n(Bailey et al. 1976, Flora of China 2012, Hedrick 1919, van Wyk 2005.)\r\n"

        "The Fava Bean (<i>Vicia faba</i>) is a temperate crop which originated in the Mediterranean region or southwestern Asia, along with the <a href=\"https://eol.org/pages/703192/overview\">Garden Pea</a>, <a href= https://eol.org/pages/647510/overview>Lentil</a>, and <a href=\"https://eol.org/pages/685208/overview\">Chickpea</a> (although the Fava Bean probably originated later than these others). The earliest known archaeological Fava Bean remains are from the Neolithic period (6800 to 6500 B.C.E.) from Israel. Around 3000 B.C.E., numerous archaeological remains appear in the Mediterranean region and central Europe. Until <i>Phaseolus</i> beans were introduced from the New World in post-Columbian times, Fava Beans were a common food for many Mediterranean and Near East civilizations, including the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Fava Bean spread along the Nile valley to Ethiopia, as well as to northern India and China. The Fava Bean's wild ancestor is unknown. \r\n\r\nToday, Fava Beans are cultivated in more than 50 countries, with China accounting for a large fraction of world production. The plant is an erect hardy annual with a distinctive four-ribbed stem, either single or sparsely branched. The <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/learn/biodiversity_counts/ident_help/Parts_Plants/leaf_type.htm\">compound leaves</a> are composed of a few large leaflets and bear large <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipule\">stipules</a> at their bases. The white, black-blotched flowers are borne in axillary clusters. The plant may produce fruits known as \"longpods\", with up to eight seeds,, or \"Windsors\", with shorter pods containing up to four seeds. The seeds are highly variable in shape, color (white, green, buff brown, purple, or black), and size (6 to 20 mm in length).\r\n\r\nThe immature seeds (beans) may be cooked as a vegetable, canned, or frozen. The dry mature seeds can used as human food or animal feed. Seed flour has been used for bread.  Whole immature pods have also been used as food. In Egypt, Fava Beans are an important part of the diets of many people as an ingredient in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foul_Madammas\">ful</a>. The dried seeds contain 25% protein, 1.5% fat, and 49% carbohydrate. The young beans contain around 80% water, but significant levels of carotenes and Vitamin C.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its use as food for humans and livestock, Fava Bean plays a critical role in some agricultural systems due to the ability of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria it harbors to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation\">fix atmospheric nitrogen</a> under a broad spectrum of environmental conditions. This facilitates diversification of the agroecosystem in both time (via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_rotation\">crop rotations</a>) and in space (via intercrops), which also may indirectly enhance associated diversity of wild flora and fauna, as well as soil microbes, which may in turn impact the sustainability of agricultural systems. (Köpke and Nemecek 2010)\r\n\r\nFava Beans in the Mediterranean region are responsible for a form of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolytic_anemia\">hemolytic anemia</a> known as \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favism\">favism</a>\". It occurs in individuals with a genetic deficiency of an enzyme know as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase\">glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase</a> (G6PD). Pythagoras was said to suffer from this disorder. \r\n\r\n(Vaughan and Geissler 1997)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "<i>Pisum sativum</i>, the common pea (also known as the garden or field pea), is an herbaceous annual in the Fabaceae (formerly Leguminosae) family, originally from the Mediterraean basin and Near East, but now widely grown for its seedpod or legume (a simple dry fruit containing several seeds and splitting along seams on two sides). The term “pea” can refer to small spherical seed or to the pod. The name “peas” is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae, such as chickpeas (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>), pigeon peas (<i>Cajanus cajan</i>), cowpeas (<i>Vigna unguiculata</i>), and sweet peas (several <i>Lathyrus</i> spp.), which are grown as ornamentals. \r\n\r\n<i>P. sativum</i> cultivars are either low growing (less than 0.75 meters) or vining. The vining cultivars grow thin tendrils from leaves that coil around any available support and can climb to be 1–2 m high.  <i>P. sativum</i> is a cool-season crop grown in many parts of the world; planting can take place from winter to early summer depending on location. The distinctive flower has 5 fused sepals, 5 petals, 10 stamens (9 fused in a staminal tube and 1 stamen is free), and one carpel, which develops into a pod with multiple peas. The average pea weighs 0.1 to 0.4 grams.\r\n\r\nPeas appear to have been cultivated for nearly 7,000 years. The earliest archaeological finds of peas come from Neolithic Syria, Turkey and Jordan. In Egypt, evidence of peas dates from ca. 4800–4400 BC.\r\n\r\nPeapods are botanically a fruit, but peas are called a vegetable in cooking. They are used as a vegetable, fresh, frozen or canned, and some varieties, such as split peas, are dried; these varieties are typically called field peas. Along with broad beans and lentils, these formed an important part of the diet of most people in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe during the Middle Ages. By the 17th and 18th centuries it had become popular to eat peas \"green,\" or fresh, while they are immature and right after they are picked, especially in France and England. The popularity of green peas spread to North America, where Thomas Jefferson grew more than 30 cultivars of peas on his estate. The “pease porridge” of nursery-rhyme fame is a traditional dish in England made from yellow dried peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are high in fiber, protein, vitamins (folate and vitamin C), minerals (iron, magnesium, phosphorus and zinc), and lutein (a yellow carotenoid pigment that benefits vision). Dry weight is about one-quarter protein and one-quarter carbohydrates (mostly sugars). \r\n\r\nGlobal production in 2009 of green peas was 16 million tons, harvested from 2.1 million hectares, with an additional 10.5 million tons of dried peas, from 6.2 million hectares (FAOSTAT 2011). In some agricultural regions, such as the Punjab in India, peas are second only to wheat as a cultivated crop (Singla et al. 2006).\r\n"

        "Wild Parsnip (<i>Pastinaca sativa</i>) is a tall, stout, herbaceous plant with a long (up to 1.5 m), thick taproot (Gleason and Cronquist 1991). Parsnip is native to Eurasia between the western Mediterranean region and the Caucasus Mountains. It now grows wild throughout southern and central Europe and was long ago introduced into the United Kingdom and northern Europe. It is also now found growing wild in Australia, Canada and the United States, China and Japan, New Zealand, southern Africa, and southern South America. In many regions, Wild Parsnip is now viewed as a weed of concern. In North America, it is predominantly found in the eastern part of the continent, but it is widely naturalized across the United States, colonizing old fields, railroad embankments, roadsides, and waste areas. Parsnip was introduced to North America shortly after European settlement as an important root crop. It subsequently escaped cultivation and naturalized as a less palatable ‘‘wild’’ form. Wild Parsnip grows best in rich, alkaline, moist soils, but can survive under poor soil conditions and under drought conditions (perhaps as a result of its deep tap root). (Vaughan and Geissler 1997; Menemen et al. 2001 and references therein; Averill and DiTommaso 2007 and references therein) \r\n\r\nThe cultivated form of Parsnip, which has a thicker and more succulent root, is grown in temperate regions all over the world. Its root is used as animal fodder or as a cooked vegetable (delicious simply broiled with a drizzle of olive oil!). Parsnip was cultivated in Roman times, but fleshy forms were not developed until the Middle Ages. The root contains around 6% starch and 6% sugar; exposure to frost supposedly increases the conversion of starch to sugar. Vitamin C content is 17 mg/100g. Parsnip has sometimes been used to make wine. (Vaughan and Geissler 1997)\r\n\r\nThe Parsnip plant has a characteristic smell; hollow, furrowed stems; and large, <a href=\"https://www.google.fr/imgres?imgurl=https://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/98/5598-004-08808ACE.gif&imgrefurl=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/media/374/Common-leaf-morphologies&h=370&w=600&sz=52&tbnid=D1qgmfbOgyHbLM:&tbnh=78&tbnw=127&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dleaf%2Bmorphology%26tbm%3Disch%26tbo%3Du&zoom=1&q=leaf+morphology&usg=__xtgHRS4VqTGmdxFJtNozqoaughY=&docid=Ptfs5opZ2-SCjM&sa=X&ei=JpTkT9CTDojX8gP_u-C7Cg&ved=0CGoQ9QEwAQ&dur=503\">simple, pinnate leaves with ovate and toothed leaflets</a>. The small yellow flowers are borne in an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbel\">umbel</a> that may be as much as 10 cm across.  (Vaughan and Geissler 1997)\r\n\r\nParsnip contains <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furanocoumarin\">furanocoumarins</a>, which deter herbivores from eating its foliage. These compounds can also cause <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytophotodermatitis\">phytophotodermatitis</a> in humans and livestock, a condition that results in patches of redness and blisters on the skin when they come into contact with the sap or ingest parts of the plant in the presence of sunlight. (Menemen et al. 2001)\r\n\r\nParsnip has been the subject of diverse studies investigating the chemical ecology and evolution of plant-herbivore interactions (<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/105/12/4547.abstract\">Zanger et al. 2008 and references therein</a>). \r\n\r\nAverill and DiTommaso (2007) and Cain et al. (2010) reviewed the biology and ecology of this species.\r\n\r\nWild Parsnip is one of eight species and four subspecies in the genus <i>Pastinaca</i>, all of them native to Europe and Asia (Menemen et al. 2001 and references therein).\r\n"

        "<i>Lactuca sativa</i>, lettuce or garden lettuce, is a leafy annual or perennial herb in the Asteraceae (aster or composite family) that originated in the Mediterranean and Near East and is now cultivated commercially and in home gardens worldwide for its leafy greens, which are the most widely used salad crop. The species, which is not known in the wild but is thought to have been developed from the wild lettuce, <i>L. serriola</i>, around 4,500 years ago in Egypt, has been developed into diverse cultivars that vary in leaf shape (ruffled, toothed, or fairly smooth), growth form (loose clusters of leaves or leaves packed densely into heads to stem lettuce with leaves on edible stems), and leaf color (ranging from light to dark green to reddish to purple, or green tinged with reddish or purple).\r\n\r\nLettuce grows with a basal rosette of leaves up to 15 cm (10 in) long, loosely or tightly clustered, and is generally harvested before the flowering stem has bolted. If allowed to bolt, the plant may reach nearly 1 m (3 ft) tall, with yellow composite flowers that develop tan or black achenes (small, one-seeded fruits with hard coverings that do not split open (dehisce) when ripe) with white beaks. \r\n\r\nLettuce cultivars are generally divided into several groups by growth form:\r\n\r\n1.\tHead or cabbage lettuce, which forms dense, tightly packed heads, like cabbage, and includes the common cultivar ‘Iceberg.’\r\n\r\n2.\tRomaine or cos lettuce, with long (often up to 15 cm, or 10 in), upright, broad-stemmed leaves that form loose heads.\r\n\r\n3.\tCurled or leaf lettuce, with a non-heading rosette of round ruffled, fringed, or crisp leaves.\r\n\r\n4.\tButterhead lettuce, with soft leaves in loose heads.\r\n\r\n5.\tStem lettuce or celtuce, in which the stems are enlarged, and are the part harvested and eaten.\r\n\r\nLettuce is generally eaten fresh in salads, although there are numerous dishes in which the leaves are stuffed, braised, cooked or softened with cream or butter, or pureed. In stem lettuce, the stems are cooked as a vegetable. \r\n\r\nThe FAO estimates that total global commercial production of lettuce was 23.6 million metric tons (mmt) in 2010, harvested from 1.1 million hectares. China led production with 12.6 mmt, just over half the world total, while the second-ranked U.S. produced 4.0 mmt, accounting for another 17%. Italy, India, and Spain were the other countries with harvests of more than 800,000 metric tons. (FAO tracks statistics for lettuce production together with chicory, which includes both <i>Cichorium endivia</i>, endive, and <i>Cichorium intybus</i>, chicory—both of which are used as salad greens, although the root of <i>C. intybus</i> is also harvested to be roasted for use as coffee additive or substitute.) \r\n\r\n(Bailey et al. 1976, FAOSTAT 2012, van Wyk 2005.)"

        "<i>Brassica oleracea</i>, wild cabbage, is a species in the Brassicaceae (the cabbage or mustard family) from which numerous vegetable crops have been derived, including broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, collards, Chinese broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, curly kale, and kohlrabi, among others. Although the varieties are so numerous as to complicate a general description, the plant is generally stout herbaceous annual, biennial, or occasionally perennial with smooth, glaucous (waxy), rounded lower leaves, which originated in Europe and has been cultivated since Roman times or before. It is most commonly grown in north temperate regions, as it requires a cool growing season and abundant moisture, and its numerous varieties are popular in home gardens.\r\n\r\n<i>B. olearacea</i>, along with the cultivars of <i>B. juncea</i> and <i>B. rapa</i>, have such a long history of cultivation and diversification that it can be difficult to ascertain and classify the relationships among species and varieties (or subspecies). Varieties of <i>B. olearacea</i> are generally placed into the following eight groups:\r\n\r\n1)\tvar. <i>acephala</i>, which includes some types of kale, collards, palm cabbage, and Portuguese cabbage, all used for their leaves, which are generally used as a cooked vegetable or in soups, but are sometimes marinated in dressing and used as a salad. \r\n\r\n2)\tvar. <i>alboglabra</i>, Chinese broccoli or Chinese kale, which produces fleshy stems and crowded flower buds; the stems, flower buds, and young leaves are generally used as a cooked vegetable and are typical in Asian stir fries, soups, and noodle dishes. \r\n\r\n3)\tvar. <i>botrytris</i>, cauliflower, including purple cultivars (Cape broccoli), as well as the pyramid-shaped Italian cultivars (Romanesco), which have large fleshy stems and flower buds that do not open; the stems and buds, which form heads, are served raw in salads or used as a cooked vegetable.\r\n\r\n4)\tvar. <i>capitata</i>, which includes cabbage (sometimes referred to as white cabbage), red cabbage, and Savoy cabbage, in which the large, rounded leaves grow together densely together with a fleshy stem to form a “head,” which is used raw in salads, pickled or fermented (in the German sauerkraut as well as in numerous other regional dishes), or cooked as a vegetable in many northern European cuisines.\r\n\r\n5)\tvar. <i>gemmifera</i>, Brussels sprouts, which forms numerous large axillary buds (where leaf joins stem), with leaves so densely packed as to form small heads, and numerous of these buds ascending a central stalk that can grow to 1 m (3 ft) tall; the buds are used as a cooked vegetable, featured in various typical French dishes. The large stem leaves may also be used as a cooked green.\r\n\r\n6)\tvar. <i>gongylodes</i>, kohlrabi, which has a greatly enlarged, bulbous, above-ground stem, with the leaves often growing in a crown around the outer edge; the stem may be used raw in salads but is more typically cooked and prepared similarly to turnips or used in soups. The leaves may also be used as a cooked green.\r\n\r\n7)\tvar. <i>italica</i>, broccoli, which has thick fleshy stalks and a large head of densely packed flowerbuds; the stems are harvested while flower buds are still immature and tightly closed, and used raw or as a cooked vegetable. Broccoli is a highly nutritious vegetable, with a high vitamin C content and numerous other vitamins and minerals, while low in calories.\r\n\r\n8)\tvar. <i>sabellica</i>, curly and Portuguese kales, which are short-lived perennials from which the leaves can be harvested for several years; the leaves are generally used as a cooked green, notably in Portuguese dishes including the traditional kale soup known as “caldo verde,” but may also be marinated in dressing and used raw in salads.\r\n\r\nStatistics on the production of this diverse group of vegetables are difficult to aggregate. The FAO tracks a category called “cabbages and other Brassica species,” which covers all the varieties of <i>B. olearacea</i> but includes related species as well. However, this category suggests at least the general level of commercial production of these vegetables, which the FAO estimated was 60 million metric tons worldwide in 2010, harvested from 2.1 million hectares. Leading producers were China, India, the Russian Federation, Japan and Korea; the U.S. ranked 9th in total production. \r\n\r\n(Bailey et al. 1976, FAOSTAT 2012, Hedrick 1919, van Wyk 2005.)"

        "<i>Allium cepa</i>, the onion (also called bulb onion or common onion) and the shallot (<i>A. cepa</i> var. <i>aggregatum</i>), is a monocot bulbous perennial (often biannual). It is the most widely cultivated species of the genus <i>Allium</i>, which includes other important species such as garlic (<i>A. sativum</i>) and leeks (<i>A. ampeloprasum</i>). The name \"wild onion\" is applied to various <i>Alliums. </i>\r\n\r\n<i>Allium</i> species are among the oldest cultivated crops. Diverse representations in Egyptian artifacts dating to 2700 B.C suggest that onions had been cultivated and in wide use by that time (Fritsch and Friesen 2002). The present species, <i>A. cepa</i>, is known only from cultivation, but appears to have been domesticated from wild ancestors in the Central Asian mountains (Brewster 1994).\r\n\r\nNumerous cultivars have been developed for size, form, color, storability, resistance to pests and pathogens, and climatic adaptations. Cultivars are divided into the Common Onion Group (<i>A. cepa</i> var. <i>cepa</i>), which contains most of the economically important varieties (including cultivars grown for green or salad onions) and the Aggregatum Group, which includes shallots and potato onions, and typically produce clusters of small bulbs (Brewster 1994). \r\n\r\nOnions are widely used on cooking in nearly all regions of the world, and have been used in diverse cultures and rituals throughout history. (See Wikipedia article in full entry; additional details in Block 2010 and Brewster 1994.) \r\n\r\nOnions produce various sulfur-containing compounds (such as cysteine sulfoxide), probably for defense against fungi and insects, that, together with their breakdown products, produce their distinctive odor, flavor, and lachrymatory (tear-stimulating) properties (Brewster 1994). Throughout history, onions have been used in folk medicine for purposes ranging from treating wounds and stomach ailments to treating infertility (Wikipedia 2011). Scientific and pharmacological studies since World War II have found evidence that onions or their derived compounds have antimicrobial and antifungal properties, and may also be of benefit in preventing or treating heart disease and atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, and possibly asthma (Brewster 1994, Griffiths et al. 2002). \r\n\r\nDespite their benefits to humans, onions are toxic to cattle, cats, and dogs, and, to a lesser extent, sheep and goats (Cope 2011, Merck 2011). Consumption by these animals of large amounts of onion may lead to anemia and impaired oxygen transport.\r\n\r\nGlobal production of onions in 2008 was second only to tomatoes among horticultural crops: more than 73 million metric tons harvested from 3.6 million hectares. China alone produced more than 20 million metric tons; other leading producers were India, Australia, the United States, Pakistan, and Turkey (FAOSTAT 2011). <i>A. cepa</i> has escaped cultivation or naturalized in much of eastern North America as well as California and the Pacific Northwest (USDA PLANTS 2011), but generally remains localized. It is classified as a noxious weed in Arkansas (along with all <i>Alliums</i>).\r\n\r\nOnions have large cells visible under low magnification, so onion tissue is often used in high school science laboratories for learning about microscope use and cell structure, as shown in this lesson from Rice University (<a href=\"https://teachertech.rice.edu/Participants/dawsonm/cells/microlab4.htm\">https://teachertech.rice.edu/Participants/dawsonm/cells/microlab4.htm</a>) and this video of onion cells from YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tdch3mxQ4oU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tdch3mxQ4oU</a>.\r\n"
