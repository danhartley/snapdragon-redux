Distinguishing factors are color (the true chanterelle is uniform egg-yellow, while the false chanterelle is more orange in hue and graded, with darker center) and attachment of gills to the stem (the true chanterelle has ridges or wrinkles, which can be quite deep, but not true gills).'

H. americanum only found east of the ROCKSies. H. coralloides spines mostly under half an inch in length that are at best inconsistently downward-pointing; specimens much more branched than compact.'

Redstarts \'bob\' in a very robin-like manner, but spend little time at ground level.'
