        Medium sized mushroom with a conical, honeycomb-pitted cap, and vertically oriented pits and ridges.
        
        Key feature: ridges are dark especially at maturity and the pits are lighter in colour.
        
        It is hollow in cross-section from top to bottom including the stem.
        
        Key feature: the cap is fully attached to stem but with a small groove or sinus where the base of the cap meets the stem.
        
        Habitat: under ash, black cherry, tulip poplar.

        A medium sized species to 6" or taller.
        
        Like other members of the black morel clade it has a conical cap with vertically oriented pits and ridges that darken at maturity.
                
        It is entirely hollow from top to bottom.
        
        Key feature:  the bottom of the cap hangs free from the stem, like a skirt i.e. not fully attached (hence its name).
        
        Habitat: ash, tulip poplar, American elm, and black cherry.

        Smell: cucumber or watermelon rind.
        
        Season: most prolific in spring, (but may be found in summer and fall).

        The spores are pale lilac or white.
        
        Habitat: oyster mushrooms are decomposers of wood, and only appear on wood (though this may be hidden).

        Key feature: the cap contains fine granules when young and fresh, but with age and weathering they may be lost.
                
        The spore print is black.

        Habitat: they form in large clusters on or around stumps and logs, and the buried wood of commonly broadleaf trees: cherry, ash, oak.
        
        Season: all year, but especially in spring.
