        There are 4 similar species, all are edible (though a microscope may be needed to distinguish between them).
                
        The gills partially deliquesce with age leaving an inky goo.

        Key feature: the cap contains fine granules when young and fresh, but with age and weathering they may be lost.
                
        The spore print is black.

        Ecology: they form in large clusters on or around stumps and logs, and the buried wood of commonly broadleaf trees: cherry, ash, oak.
        
        Season: all year, but especially in spring.
        
        Culinary: this species does not contain coprine (which reacts with alcohol), but other ink caps do.`
