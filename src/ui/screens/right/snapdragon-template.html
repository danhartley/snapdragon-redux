        <p>Snapdragon improves your ability to recognise and name species.</p>
        <p>The casual observer will learn about the trees, plants and animals they see around them every day.</p>
        <p>Dedicated naturalists have the opportunity to study the features that are common to species and that link them.</p>
        <p>Species are tested as part of a collection. How species are grouped reflects why you want to learn be it for an exam, a hike, a dive, or planning a garden.</p>
