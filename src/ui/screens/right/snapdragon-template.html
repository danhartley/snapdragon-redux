        <p>Welcome to Snapdragon.</p>
        <p>Snapdragon improves your ability to recognise and name species.</p>
        <p>The casual observer will learn about the trees, plants and animals they see around them every day.</p>
        <p>Dedicated naturalists have the opportunity to study the features that are common to species and that link them.</p>
        <p>Snapdragon is all about learning and the best way to do that is to put new found knowledge to the test.</p>
        <p>Snapdragon tests are based on collections. Pick the collection that interests you and start learning. The tests increase in difficulty as you proceed.</p>
        <p>For example Quercus suber, the Cork Oak, is part of the Mediterranean 1 collection. Your abililty to recognise this tree and identify its common and scientific names will be tested first. The final test requires you to enter the full scientific - or latin - name so pay attention along the way!</p>
        <p>To see details of a specimen click on an image. Depending on the size of your screen you will see links that display additional information or take you to other sites such as Wikipedia.</p>
        <p>Good luck!</p>
